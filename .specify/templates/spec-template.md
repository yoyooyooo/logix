# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

_Example of marking unclear requirements:_

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Non-Functional Requirements (Performance & Diagnosability)

<!--
  If this feature touches Logix runtime hot paths, treat performance and
  diagnosability as first-class requirements:
  - Define budgets (time/alloc/memory) and how they are measured
  - Define what diagnostic events/Devtools surfaces exist and their overhead
-->

- **NFR-001**: System MUST define performance budgets for the affected hot paths
  and record a measurable baseline (benchmark/profile) before implementation.
- **NFR-002**: System MUST provide structured diagnostic signals for key state /
  flow transitions, and diagnostics MUST have near-zero overhead when disabled.
- **NFR-003**: System MUST use deterministic identifiers for instances/transactions
  in diagnostic and replay surfaces (no random/time defaults).
- **NFR-004**: System MUST enforce a synchronous transaction boundary: no IO/async
  work inside a transaction window, and no out-of-transaction write escape hatches.
- **NFR-005**: If this feature changes runtime performance boundaries or introduces
  an automatic policy, the project MUST update user-facing documentation to provide
  a stable mental model: (≤5 keywords), a coarse cost model, and an “optimization ladder”
  (default → observe → narrow writes → stable rowId → module/provider override & tuning → split/refactor).
  Vocabulary MUST stay aligned across docs, benchmarks, and diagnostic evidence fields.
- **NFR-006**: If this feature relies on internal hooks or cross-module collaboration
  protocols, the system MUST encapsulate them as explicit injectable contracts
  (Runtime Services) that are mockable per instance/session, and MUST support exporting
  slim, serializable evidence/IR for a controlled trial run in Node.js or browsers
  without relying on process-global singletons.
- **NFR-007**: If this feature introduces breaking changes, the project MUST provide a
  migration note (plan.md / PR) and MUST NOT keep compatibility layers or a deprecation
  period (forward-only evolution).

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
- **SC-005**: [Performance metric, e.g., "No regression in p95 latency / allocations for [hot path]"]
- **SC-006**: [Diagnosability metric, e.g., "Devtools can explain 'why' for [event] with causal chain"]
