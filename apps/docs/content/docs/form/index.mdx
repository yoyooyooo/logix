`@logixjs/form` is the “form domain package” in the Logix ecosystem. It hosts a form’s **values / errors / UI / submit state** as a regular module inside the Runtime, so your form and the rest of your application share the same:

- Runtime lifecycle and transaction semantics (at most one observable commit per interaction)
- Debugging and replay (DevTools timeline, error tree, state snapshots)
- Declarative derivation / validation / async resources (Trait / Resource / Effect)

## Recommended order (from basics to advanced)

1. [Overview: the Form model](./introduction)
2. [Quick Start](./quick-start)
3. [Rules DSL（z）](./rules)
4. [Validation & errors](./validation)
5. [Field arrays](./field-arrays)
6. [Migration guide (traits → rules)](./migration)
7. [Derived and linked fields (derived / Trait)](./derived)
8. [Schema validation & error mapping](./schema)
9. [Performance & optimization](./performance)

## What you’ll get

- Understand why `Form.make(...)` returns a `Blueprint`, and how to wire it into the Runtime like any other module
- Learn why the error tree uses the `$list/rows[]` convention, and how to keep errors and UI state stable when rows are added/removed/reordered
- Use `validateOn / reValidateOn` to design validation strategies for “before submit / after submit”, and trigger precise validation via a controller outside React components
- In large forms/lists, reduce render and validation cost with selector subscriptions and stable identity
