title: Guide Overview
description: Learning path and navigation for the Logix Guide.
---

The Logix Guide is for frontend and full-stack developers who are new to Effect. It helps you build up the right mental model step by step:

- How to manage state with Modules
- How to write business logic with Logic and the Bound API (`$`)
- When you should learn lower-level concepts like Effect / Stream

## Recommended order

1. **Get Started**
   - For: first-time Logix users who want a runnable demo in ~30 minutes.
   - Path:
     1. [Introduction](/docs/guide/get-started/introduction)
     2. [Quick Start: Your first app](/docs/guide/get-started/quick-start)
     3. [Tutorial: Your first business flow (cancelable search)](/docs/guide/get-started/tutorial-first-app)

2. **Essentials**
   - For: you’ve shipped the first demo and want to write Modules / Logic / Flow the “right” way.
   - Path:
     1. [Thinking in Logix](/docs/guide/essentials/thinking-in-logix)
     2. [Modules & State](/docs/guide/essentials/modules-and-state)
     3. [Flows & Effects](/docs/guide/essentials/flows-and-effects)
     4. [Traits (capability rules and convergence)](/docs/guide/essentials/traits)
     5. [Effect basics: learn the 20% you need](/docs/guide/essentials/effect-basics)
     6. [Lifecycle](/docs/guide/essentials/lifecycle)

3. **Learn**
   - For: you’re already using Logix and start hitting cross-module collaboration and complex async workflows.
   - Suggested path:
     - [Describing modules](/docs/guide/learn/describing-modules)
     - [Managing state](/docs/guide/learn/managing-state)
     - [Lifecycle and watchers](/docs/guide/learn/lifecycle-and-watchers)
     - [Cross-module communication](/docs/guide/learn/cross-module-communication)
     - [Deep dive](/docs/guide/learn/deep-dive)

4. **Advanced / Recipes**
   - For: you have some Effect / FP background and want to standardize patterns across a team (or build reusable Patterns).
   - Good entry points:
     - [Suspense and async initialization](/docs/guide/advanced/suspense-and-async)
     - [Error handling](/docs/guide/advanced/error-handling)
     - [Debugging and DevTools](/docs/guide/advanced/debugging-and-devtools)
     - [Testing](/docs/guide/advanced/testing)
     - [React integration recipes](/docs/guide/recipes/react-integration)

## Domain package: Form

If you’re building B2B forms or complex dynamic lists, you can go straight to the `@logixjs/form` track (from basics to advanced):

- [Form overview](/docs/form)
- [Quick Start](/docs/form/quick-start)
- [Field arrays](/docs/form/field-arrays)

> Tip: if you’re completely new to Effect, follow the getting-started path first. You can treat it as a “more powerful `async/await`” and come back to Essentials / Learn when you need more details.
