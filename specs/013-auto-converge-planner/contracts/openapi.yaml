  description: >
    Contracts for Auto Converge Planner: decision summary, cache evidence, generation bump signals,
    and static IR build evidence. This feature is an extension to Spec 009 DynamicTrace; it is
    schema-first documentation for runtime/devtools/sandbox alignment and does not imply a
    specific transport or server implementation.
