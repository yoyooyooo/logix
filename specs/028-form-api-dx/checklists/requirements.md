# Specification Quality Checklist: Form API 收敛与 DX 提升

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `$speckit clarify` or `$speckit plan`
- Iteration 1 issues addressed:
  - 移除具体文件路径与过度工程化术语；用更面向使用者的表述替代。
  - 补充 Out of Scope 明确边界。
