# Specification Quality Checklist: UI Projection Contract（语义编排与 UI 投影解耦）

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

## Notes

- 本 spec 约束“语义蓝图 vs UI 投影”的边界与验收口径；具体数据结构版本化、表达式规范化、端口/类型导出与预算等实现细节留到 `$speckit plan` 阶段落地。
