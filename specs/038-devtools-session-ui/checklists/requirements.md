# Specification Quality Checklist: Logix Devtools Session-First 界面重设计

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-26  
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Notes

- 本功能面向开发者工具；spec 中保留了必要术语（如“提交/事务/会话”），但尽量用可解释的方式表达，避免依赖实现细节。
