# Specification Quality Checklist: SchemaAST 分层能力升级
 
**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-26  
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)
 
## Content Quality
 
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
 
## Requirement Completeness
 
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
 
## Feature Readiness
 
- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
 
## Notes
 
- 本规格以“能力落点清单 + 可验收结果”为先，细化阶段建议在 `$speckit plan` 中分期并补齐性能预算与证据链路落点。
