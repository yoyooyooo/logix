# Specification Quality Checklist: Playground 编辑器智能提示（Logix 全量补全）

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-29  
**Feature**: `specs/061-playground-editor-intellisense/spec.md`

## Content Quality

- [x] No unnecessary implementation details leak (allowed: language semantics / budgets needed for acceptance)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for intended stakeholders (Playground users/maintainers)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria avoid locking into a specific editor implementation
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] NFR budget verification method is defined in `quickstart.md`

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `$speckit clarify` or `$speckit plan`
