# Specification Quality Checklist: logix-galaxy-api（PostgreSQL 接口服务样例）

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-30  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `$speckit clarify` or `$speckit plan`
- 本特性为工程示例服务，“接口路径/响应形状/端口/数据库类型”等被视为对外契约与显式约束；spec 避免了语言/框架/代码结构等实现细节。
